# SarcASM_analysis
This script uses the SarcAsM (https://sarcasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest) toolkit to automatically detect and analyze sarcomeres in single-channel TIFF microscopy images.   It processes all images in a given folder, generates orientation/Z-band/M-band/mask maps, and compiles key quantitative metrics into a single CSV file.
